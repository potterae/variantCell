# Creating a new variantCell project

If you haven't already done so, you can create a new project by using
the command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Create new variantCell object
project <- variantCell$new()
```

to initialize the project.

# Building the SNP database

To build the SNP database, first you need to add each sample
individually, optionally specifying donor and recipient (please see
tutorial for identifying donor/recipient).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# add one sample to SNP database
  addSampleData = function(
    sample_id,
    vireo_path          = NULL,
    cellsnp_path,
    cell_data,
    data_type           = "seurat",
    prefix_text,
    donor_type          = NULL,
    non_transplant_mode = FALSE,
    min_cells           = 0,
    min_alt_frac        = 0,
    normalize           = TRUE,
    scale.factor        = 10000,
    sample_metadata     = NULL
  ) 
```

This is an example, setting donor and recipient (for transplant mode):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# usage example

    project$addSampleData(
      sample_id    = "Sample1",
      vireo_path   = "/path/to/donor_ids.tsv",
      cellsnp_path = "/path/to/cellSNP/dir/",
      cell_data    = seuratObj,
      data_type    = 'seurat',
      prefix_text  = "Patient1_Sample1_",
      normalize    = TRUE,
      donor_type   = c(donor0 = "Donor", donor1 = "Recipient")
    )
```

For initial analysis, it is recommended not to perform any filtering
(min_cells=0, min_alt_frac=0) as this will help facilitate downstream DE
analysis and plotting. If normalize is set to TRUE, size factor
normalization is performed, using total DP (SNP counts) for each cell.
Downstream analysis can then optionally use the normalized SNP counts.

After the samples have been added, you can build a unified SNP database
by executing the function:

`buildSNPDatabase()`

ie, `vCell_project$buildSNPDatabase()`
