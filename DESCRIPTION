Description: Analyzes single-cell SNP data with a focus on transplant settings. 
    Works with single-cell genomics workflows to identify, characterize, 
    and visualize SNPs at cellular resolution, enabling researchers to distinguish 
    donor from recipient cells and quantify SNPs that may influence transplant outcomes.
