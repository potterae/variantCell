A tool for analyzing single-cell SNP data with focus on organ transplant.

## Overview

variantCell is an R-based computational tool designed to analyze single-cell SNP data with a particular focus on transplant settings. It works with widely-used single-cell genomics workflows to identify, characterize, and visualize SNPs at cellular resolution, enabling researchers to distinguish donor from recipient cells and quantify SNPs that may influence transplant outcomes.

The package provides a comprehensive framework for processing CellSNP and Vireo output, normalizing SNP counts, and performing differential SNP analysis across cell types or clinical conditions. With built-in visualization capabilities, users can explore variant distributions within genes of interest and create SNP heatmaps across cell clusters.

Unlike existing approaches that analyze variants at the bulk tissue level, variantCell leverages single-cell resolution to reveal cell type-specific genetic signals and heterogeneity within transplanted tissues. This approach offers unique insights into the genetic factors driving transplant rejection, immune response variation, and cellular chimerism in complex tissues, with applications extending to cancer, development, and other areas where genetic mosaicism is biologically significant.
