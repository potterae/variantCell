\title{variantCell: Single-Cell SNP Analysis for Transplant Studies
variantCell: A tool for analyzing single-cell SNP data with focus on organ transplant}
\description{
A tool for analyzing single-cell SNP data with focus on organ transplant.
variantCell processes CellSNP and Vireo output to identify, characterize, and
visualize SNPs at cellular resolution, enabling researchers to distinguish donor from
recipient cells and quantify SNPs that may influence transplant outcomes.

\itemize{
\item Processing CellSNP and Vireo output data
\item SNP identification and characterization across cell types
\item Differential SNP analysis
\item Visualization of SNP distributions and patterns
\item Integration with single-cell metadata
}
