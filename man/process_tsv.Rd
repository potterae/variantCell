\title{process_tsv: Process a TSV file with prefix addition}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character. Path to the TSV file to be read.}

\item{prefix_column}{Character. Name of the column to which the prefix should be added
and which will be used as row names.}

\item{prefix_text}{Character. Text to prepend to each value in the specified column.}
}
\value{
A data frame where:
\itemize{
\item The specified column has been prefixed with the given text
\item The modified column has been set as row names
\item The column itself has been removed from the data frame
}
}
\description{
Reads a TSV file, adds a prefix to a specified column, and sets that column
as row names in the resulting data frame. This function is typically used to preprocess
sample metadata files and ensure cell identifiers match across different data sources.
}
\details{
This function is particularly useful when processing Vireo donor assignment files
that need to be integrated with other single-cell data (like Seurat objects), where
cell identifiers need to match exactly for proper merging.
}
\note{
The function assumes that the file exists and is formatted as a proper TSV file.
No validation is performed to check if the column specified by \code{prefix_column} exists
in the TSV file.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Process a donor assignment file for Vireo
donor_meta <- process_tsv(
  file_path = "path/to/donor_ids.tsv",
  prefix_column = "cell",
  prefix_text = "Patient1_Sample3_"
)

# Now donor_meta has the prefixed cell IDs as row names
# and can be easily matched with Seurat object cell barcodes
}

}
