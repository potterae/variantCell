\title{getCurrentIdentity: Get Current Project-Wide Cell Identity Information}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing:
\item{identity}{Character. Name of the current identity column.}
\item{distribution}{Table. Distribution of cells across identity categories.}
\item{total_cells}{Integer. Total number of cells in the dataset.}
If no identity is set, returns NULL.
}
\description{
Retrieves and displays information about the currently active cell identity variable.
This function returns details about which metadata column is being used for cell grouping
and provides a summary of the cell distribution across the different identity categories.
}
\details{
This function checks whether a project-wide identity has been set using
\code{setProjectIdentity()}. If an identity is active, it prints the name of the
identity column and displays a summary of how many cells belong to each identity category.

The function is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Verifying which grouping variable is currently active
\item Checking the cell distribution across groups before analysis
\item Confirming that identity assignments are as expected
\item Debugging when analysis results seem unexpected
}
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item If no identity has been set, the function returns NULL and displays a notification
\item The function both prints information to the console and returns data invisibly
\item The returned list can be captured and used programmatically if needed
}
}
\examples{

\dontrun{

# Check current identity
project$getCurrentIdentity()

# Capture the return value for programmatic use
id_info <- project$getCurrentIdentity()
if(!is.null(id_info)) {
  # Find the most abundant cell type
  most_common <- names(which.max(id_info$distribution))
  cat("Most common cell type:", most_common)
}

# Use in a workflow
project$setProjectIdentity("cell_type")
project$getCurrentIdentity()  # Verify it worked
project$findDESNPs(ident.1 = "T_cells")
}
}
