\title{setProjectIdentity: Set Project-Wide Cell Identity Variable}
\arguments{
\item{ident_col}{Character. Name of the column in cell_metadata to use as cell identity.
Must be an existing column in the metadata.}
}
\value{
Returns the object invisibly (for method chaining).
}
\description{
Sets the metadata column to use as the primary cell identity variable for all downstream
analyses. This function establishes which cell grouping will be used in functions like
findDESNPs() and other SNP analysis methods.
}
\details{
This function validates that the specified column exists in the cell metadata,
then sets it as the active identity for all subsequent analyses. It also prints
a summary of the unique identities found and the number of cells in each category.

The identity column is crucial for many analysis functions as it defines how cells
are grouped when comparing SNP expression or presence between populations.

Common identity variables include cell type annotations, cluster IDs, condition labels,
or any other categorical metadata that meaningfully separates cell populations.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item This function must be called before using analysis methods that rely on cell identities
\item The function prints a summary of the identities found, which can be useful for verification
\item The previously set identity (if any) is overwritten by this function
}
}
\examples{

\dontrun{

# Set cell type as the active identity

project$setProjectIdentity("cell_type")

# Use cluster IDs instead
project$setProjectIdentity("seurat_clusters")

# Set disease status as identity for case-control comparisons
project$setProjectIdentity("disease_status")

# Method chaining example
results <- project$setProjectIdentity("cell_type")$findDESNPs(
  ident.1 = "T_cells",
  donor_type = "Donor"
)
}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{getCurrentIdentity}} for checking the currently active identity
\code{\link{findDESNPs}} and \code{\link{findSNPsByGroup}} which use the set identity
